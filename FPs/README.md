# Folder structure

- **coconut**: Is a placeholder for containing the fingerprints calculated by `fp_script.py` for the **COCONUT**: database.  

- **drug_rep_hub**: Is a placeholder for containing the fingerprints calculated by `fp_script.py` for the **drug_rep_hub** database.  

Each fingerprint is saved as i.e. "ecfp.pkl" in the respective folder. The files themselves cannot be uploaded due to space limitations (the one inside is simply a placeholder), but the calculation can be reproduced by processing `coconut.csv` or `drug_rep_hub.csv` with `fp_script.py`.
