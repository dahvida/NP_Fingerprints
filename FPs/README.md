# Folder structure

Each folder contains all fingerprints computed for a given dataset. Each fingerprint is saved as e.g. "ecfp.pkl" in the respective folder. The files themselves cannot be uploaded due to space limitations (the one inside is simply a placeholder), but the calculation can be reproduced by processing `coconut.csv` or `drug_rep_hub.csv` with `fp_script.py`, or running `make_clf_script.py` with a given property (e.g. "antibiotic").
